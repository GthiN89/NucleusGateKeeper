Nucleus Gate Keeper is a specialized, compact, and cost-effective device designed for **autonomously capturing Sub-GHz RF codes** used in remote-controlled systems, such as electric gates and other Sub-GHz-controlled devices. It is a side project born out of the Nucleus ESP32 codebase, leveraging much of its functionality to ensure rapid development and deployment.

The device is compatible with **Flipper Zero** Sub-GHz `.sub` file format, allowing seamless integration with Flipper workflows for replay or further analysis.

## üìã Project Overview

Nucleus Gate Keeper simplifies the process of capturing RF codes without spending extensive time near the target device. It uses affordable and readily available hardware, focusing on **autonomous operation** and ease of use.

**Status**: In Development  
The device can autonomously receive and save codes, supports basic settings via serial or Bluetooth serial, and recognizes around 30 known protocols. While AM protocols work fine, FM protocols are currently buggy.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### üõ°Ô∏è Autonomous Code Capture
- **Autonomous RF Code Capture**: The device independently detects and saves Sub-GHz signals without manual intervention.
- **SD Card Integration**: Captured codes are stored on an SD card for easy retrieval and analysis.
- **Flipper Zero Compatibility**: Captured codes are saved in `.sub` format, compatible with Flipper Zero for replay or analysis.
- **Protocol Recognition**: Supports around 30 known Sub-GHz protocols. When a known protocol is detected, it is recorded and visible in the filename.
- **Basic Settings Management**: Allows users to adjust basic settings through USB Serial or Bluetooth Serial connections.
